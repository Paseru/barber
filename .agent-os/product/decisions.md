## 2025-08-18: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Redesign barbersworld.org as a modern, content-driven barbering platform using automated content extraction and contemporary UI/UX patterns.

### Context

The barbering industry lacks high-quality digital presence with most businesses relying on outdated websites or social media alone. There's a significant opportunity to create a modern platform that showcases barbering content, techniques, and business information in an engaging way. The original barbersworld.org contains valuable content but suffers from poor user experience and outdated design patterns.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Complete rebuild from scratch**: Would lose existing content and SEO value
2. **Simple template application**: Wouldn't address content organization and user experience issues
3. **Gradual migration**: Too slow for competitive market needs
4. **Third-party platform migration**: Would lose control and customization capabilities

### Rationale

- **Content Preservation**: MCP Puppeteer extraction ensures no valuable content is lost during modernization
- **Modern User Experience**: SHADCN UI provides contemporary, accessible design patterns that users expect
- **Industry Opportunity**: First-mover advantage in professional barbering platform space
- **Technical Efficiency**: Automated extraction and modern tooling accelerates development timeline
- **Scalability**: Foundation supports future features like booking, community, and e-commerce

### Consequences

**Expected Benefits:**
- Improved user engagement through modern UI/UX
- Better content discoverability and organization
- Enhanced mobile experience for on-the-go barbers
- Foundation for future platform expansion
- Competitive differentiation in barbering industry

**Known Tradeoffs:**
- Initial development investment required
- Potential temporary disruption during migration
- Dependency on automated extraction accuracy
- Need for ongoing content curation and quality control

### Implementation Approach

**Phase 1**: Content extraction and core page structure (2-3 weeks)
**Phase 2**: Enhanced features and interactivity (3-4 weeks)  
**Phase 3**: Community and advanced functionality (4-6 weeks)

**Key Technologies:**
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- SHADCN UI component library
- MCP Puppeteer for content extraction
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety
